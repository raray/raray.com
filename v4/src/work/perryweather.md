[Perry Weather](https://perryweather.com/) is a fast-growing company specializing in on-site weather safety monitoring for schools, sports teams, and other outdoor organizations. In 2024, they returned as a repeat client, hiring us to help increase engagement on their site through heavier use of [video and animation](#video--animation), and to speed up their content creation workflow with a [flexible but structured editing system](#composable-content).

## Video & Animation

To boost engagement and better communicate Perry Weather’s value, we built the new site around rich media. Almost every page now features [Wistia](https://wistia.com/) videos, integrated into composable content modules. These videos give site visitors immediate, visual insight into Perry Weather’s products and the problems they solve.

We also introduced animation using [Rive](https://rive.app/), which allows designers to create and control interactive animations without needing to write code. Once exported, these animations are highly performant and integrated directly into the front-end using JavaScript, giving Perry Weather motion-rich storytelling that’s fast and reliable.

## Composable Content

To streamline the pace of content creation, we built a tiered content system on WordPress that balanced customization with consistency. Using a combination of the Gutenberg editor, [Advanced Custom Fields](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/), and [Timber](https://timber.github.io/docs/), we created a library of composable modules that allow editors to build complex layouts without developer involvement.

Each component was built to be flexible enough for a range of use cases while reinforcing the overall design system. For pages with repeatable or highly specific structures—like product pages or landing campaigns—we also built templates using pre-composed components. This allows Perry Weather’s team to create new pages quickly and confidently without sacrificing visual cohesion or performance.
