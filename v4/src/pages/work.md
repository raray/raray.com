# R.A. Ray's Work

---

Hi, I'm R.A. Ray - a full-stack web developer and
technical team lead based in McKinney, Texas. I've been building the web since 2002 when I stayed up all night turning a Photoshop mockup into a gaming clan site.

Between 2020 and 2025 I led the development team at GOODFOLKS, delivering custom
solutions for high-profile clients. I've built solutions for multinational companies like [Azul](https://azul.com/) & [KIOTI](https://kioti.com/) - more local organizations like [Perry Weather](https://perryweather.com) & [Take Command Health](https://takecommandhealth.com) - and worked on internal app teams at FireScope (acquired since by [Matrix42](https://www.matrix42.com/en/)) & [Kalkomey](https://www.kalkomey.com/).

I care about writing great code that solves real business problems. No matter the stack, I aim for clean, well-organized, and efficient code thatâ€™s easy to maintain. As a team lead, I focus on creating the kind of environment where skilled developers can do their best work and take on tough challenges without roadblocks.

At home - when not working remotely - I'm usually wrangling my two sons and three pets alongisde my wife of 18 years. I'm an avid tabletop gamer, a music and art enthusiast, and a sci-fi nerd.
